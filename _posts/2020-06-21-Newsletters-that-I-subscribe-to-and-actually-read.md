I might come back and update the list in the future.



#### Scott Young's Blog

The amount of essays and the quality of the writing from Scott Young's blog site occasionally discourage me in my attempts to write more. Nonetheless I have been inspired and learning a lot from his essays.

#### Benedict's Newsletter

In his own words:

who is Benedict Evans --

> *I’ve spent 20 years analysing mobile, digital media and technology, and worked in equity research, strategy, consulting and venture capital. I’m now an independent analyst.*
>
> *I try to work out what's going on and what it means.*

what are his newsletters about --

> *This is a weekly newsletter of what I've seen in tech and thought was interesting.*



Benedict's weekly newsletter contains such a unique collection of recent interesting things in tech that I cannot find elsewhere with the same amout of ease and quality.

#### Recommendo by Kevin Kelly

> *A weekly newsletter that gives you 6 brief personal recommendations of cool stuff.*

I'd say that most people aware of Kevin Kelly might be interested in what kind of "personal cool stuff" he is up to recently. I have been reading his newletter for a while and it has given me some delightful and curious recommendations from time to time.

#### LINGUIST List

LINGUIST List is actually a mailing list distributing issues from their site rather than a conventional newsletter.

I have a background in Linguistics since 2013. I have been a subscriber since 2016 and I still scan through their daily summaries in my inbox everyday. It has been especially useful for me to keep track of the new job listings posted on their site. Not to look for new opportunites but to have a rough idea about what the job market for linguists is like -- well, most of the time it doesn't look very rosy.

#### Paul Graham's Blog

I suspect Paul Graham's personal site might be one of the most primitive-looking yet most popular blog sites you could see around the Internet nowadays. I genuinely enjoy his witty and original essays, but he is certainly too busy to set up a newsletter for his own blog (apparently there is no need to remind his readers either). But someone else has created a [RSS feed](http://www.paulgraham.com/rss.html) of Paul Graham's essays page.



#### 编程随想的博客 ProgramThink

A blog for those who (read Chinese and) embrace some non-mainstream thinking, or just fancy topics on Internet security.

#### Wait But Why

> "Sometimes humorous, almost always profound, long-form explainer site."
>
> -- Fast Company

I occasionally read those very long (as compared to the modern attention span) essays from [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com), but bizarrely I have never been successful in my several attempts to subsribe to their newsletter. It seems like my email address is blocked by them without doing anything.
