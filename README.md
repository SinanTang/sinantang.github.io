# SinanTalk - moments of serendipity

please visit: [sinantang.github.io](https://sinantang.github.io/)

collection of my main blogs (at the moment mostly in Chinese, but I'm trying to write more in English!)


I finally got a chance to reorganise and review my blogs which I've been writing since 2016.
They were riginally published on WeChat Public Space and some on Jianshu.com. With the wish to reach a more diverse readership, I picked a few satisfying articles and put them up on my new personal site now.


#### If you want to know more:
Writing is part of my life. 
I write on a broad range of topics, including books, movies, commentary, technology, business and my life. 
Most recently, I've started a new series *A Developer Guide for Newbies - Starting with Python* to challenge myself. I believe that from our generation on, everyone should and is able to master basic programming skills to explore more undiscovered opportunities of life ahead. 

So far I'm having great fun!
